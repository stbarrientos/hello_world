Hello world! This is the navigator game!

If you want to get the file and initiate a new folder with this repo in it, run this script:
mkdir ~/navigator_game;cd ~/navigator_game; git init; git clone https://github.com/stbarrientos/navigator_game; cd navigator_game; ruby navigator.rb

Alright guys so the navigator.rb file is the one I was talking about. It's gonna be hard to explain on here so just ask me in person. Thanks for helping out! This will be great git practice too.

Projects Coming Up:

Automated move method (have the computer solve the puzzle)

Improve usability, ask the user if they want to create a custom board or generate a random one

Use arrow keys and not require 'enter' to be pressed

print a special winning screen

set borders?

create logic to ensure that every randomly generated world can be won.

We are always open to suggestions!
